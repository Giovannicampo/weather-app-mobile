## Usage

npm and expo are required for the package installation and management of dependencies and stuff. Once you have installed them, execute the  following commands

- npm install (for installing dependencies)
- npx expo start (for starting the app)

> Remember: for the correct execution of API calls to the  weather server, .env file in the root directory must be edited with your own API key (instead of your_secret_key). You can create one by signing in in https://weatherapi.com.

Have fun!



## Contribute

If you'd like to share your thoughts and contribute on the project trying to implement further enhancements, please feel free to do it as much as you can. The project has got several bugs and vulnerabilities, due to the lack of testing and time I dedicated to it, but it'd be great to make it work better thanks to you!
